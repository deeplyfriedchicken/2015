1,Club Volleyball,year-end/volleyball.png,It's Called a Kill,This year I recovered from my past injuries. Woooo party. No more sprained thumbs and my knee pain hasn't been as bad as it was in high school. But occasionally it still hurts FOR NO REASON. Ugh.,"Last year, the team was really good. We had some really good freshman, a great senior, and just quality players all around. People like Bressler, Earl, and Garrett made the team intense and exciting, and I really felt like I learned a lot from them. More than high school. Except Coach Donald taught me so much I miss him. And Coach Bradford. I started to ""see"" blocks and I could swing a lot more consistently. But, I didn't get playing time because I was still underdeveleoped and needed more practice. Also I learned that you shouldn't close your eyes when you block. Who knew?","I'm closer than ever to having a starting position. My vertical is more or less around the same but my hitting has improved significantly. I wish my vertical improved but sometimes we can't always get what we want. I can now use a hard angle spike. It just happened one day I think my hand just hurt so I was hitting it different. BUT DAMN I GOT KILLS. I'm fine. Also, Simon will occasionally tell me where to spike right before I swing and I've been able to follow him more often. Lestter has helped me get in some much needed reps and my swings have improved so much. Our first tournament is in late January. Be ready."
2,Cory,year-end/totoro-backpack.png,FREAKING CORY,"So Cory got my this sweet backpack for Christmas. Totoro has been a trending part of my life recently. No complaints there because he's AWESOME. Anyways, Cory is doing well. He's certainly getting taller, good grades, good at smash, he even has a girlfriend. So overall everythings going well.",I'm really excited to see he's doing well on SAT's and academics and I want him to apply E.D. to Claremont McKenna and hopefully get in with another scholarship. He's applying to some good summer camps which will definitely make him more competitive.,"Also, his Smash characters are SO ANNOYING. Literally plays the most annoying characters. King Dedede, Game & Watch, Lemmy/Larry/Morton/KoopaNoobs/JIGGYPOOF ugh. I'm still better than him I swur."
3,Bouldering is Life,year-end/shoes.png,Bouldering is Life,"Sam and Kenny got me into bouldering Spring semester of 2015. It was really exciting actually. At first I had little to know technique, and I only used my upper body. I didn't like using my feet because they hurt and I didn't even start properly most of the time.","Now, I understand a lot more about technique and have managed to climb a number of V3's and (almost) a V4. It only gets more intense but climbing V2's and V1's are pretty standard now. It's really awesome to see yourself improve on something and get something you really wanted. For me, climbing has been a great way to destress and a way to focus something that only affects me.","At the same time, I've introduced a lot of people to climbing this year. Karen, Stephanie, David, Lestter, and even Davis and Gianna. They all have enjoyed it and found it strangely satsifying. I started belaying with Elise and it's awesome because we have enjoyable and good talks about our lives. I climbed once with Andrew and Varun and it was really cool to see them so pumped about bouldering. I'm happy to say I am almost on par with Kenny and can climb some that he can't. And I'm slowly catching up to Sam. I see you brah. "
4,Karen!,year-end/dog.png,<3 Fateful Physics?,"A slew of good decisions gave me the chance to meet this amazing person. Everything from choosing to take physics, choosing to take General Physics, and choosing to take Friday labs allowed me to meet Karen. To be honest, I just thought she was a cute and funny person at first who made lab more enjoyable. We never really talked right off the bat, and I never had truly planned to. But one day I came late and had to sit with Roxy's lab group and Karen just sent a cute picture saying the Dream Team missed me. We kinda just casually talked for a while, and didn't even meet up outside of lab until the week after.","I can honestly say I'm really lucky to have met Karen and she's such a quality person. Our love for cats, Totoro, random noises, and being general derps made us pretty solid friends. And at some point I started getting a lot more interested in her and we went climbing pretty often. Honestly going outside the bubble and doing something with another person is probably one of the most intimate things you can do. Even if you're just climbing rocks. I feel like I have the best conversations when I'm not on campus. I apologize for the small tangent. Also shady, Karen. I see you. For many, many reasons. But I actually have enjoyed every day I've spent with her, and I feel like there's still so much to learn about and grow together. God that was super corny.","I really love this dog because she got it for me during finals week when we were both super stressed. Small things like that happened all the time. She would write small little notes before exams to encourage me and make me feel better. Honestly made me really happy. Also sad because I never saw her put those in my pencil case. WHEN DID YOU? I'm fine. Karen introduced me to a lot of things, including tumblr. And it's been quite the adventure since then. But Tumblr is actually really prime. See below for my link to my tumblr. I JUST REALIZED I DON'T HAVE A CAT ON THIS SITE NUU. Neko Atsume. There we go."
5,Uke Skills,year-end/uke.png,Magic Fingers,"My brothers got me a uke last Christmas and I've learned a handful of songs on it. I played a lot before school, but I lost practice during summer and fall semester.","Super happy that I have a Uke though because it's one of those timeless things that doesn't really get old but also makes you happy and enjoy the moment. I actually really enjoyed playing uke at night time staring out my 6th floor window or outside of Beckett. Also kinda awkward though because I'd stop playing when people walked by. It was a good time, but I'm not good enough to be like ""hey I'm awesome look at me play Uke."" Nah, I can really only play Riptide, I'm Yours, and Lemonade.",Sometimes you just get kinda lazy and don't feel like learning new chords. But this year I promise I'll be different. Hopefully. lol.
6,Music,year-end/headphones.png,Why Do I Pay for Spotify,"Like every year, I copped more music from my brothers. I found out Cory has a great Soundcloud playlist and Kenny just has quality music whenever he comes home. I don't understand where they find music. I literally just go to my newsfeed on soundcloud and hit play. If I like a song I add it to my favorites playlist (Implicit Expectations, see what I did there?). I use soundcloud way more than Spotify but I'm still paying for a Spotify subscription for some reason.",Lots of Tomggg and random but really good artists are on Soundcloud. Whenever I listen to good music I can focus super well. This year I legit need to do that. No more screwing around with Honey I'm Good on Spotify.,
7,High Expectations,year-end/jersey.png,High Expectations,"I feel like I already talked about volleyball, so this is just about me being a competitive person. Tbh I was mildly burnt out this year which is sad because I have high expectations for what I should be able to do and I feel like I let myself and others down with my recent performances. But regardless, my talks with Lestter have reaffirmed that I'm still competitive. Legit went to practice after rolling my ankle who does that.",Anyways the most competitive I've been this year has been in volleyball IM's. Imagine that. It got so intense when we faced Simon's team in the playoffs in November. I still can't believe we lost ugh. AND SIMON LOST TO BECKETT WHAT THE HELL. Shmoo. But it was really nice because Karen came to lots of my games and saw me do okay. I actually did surprisingly well because usually I cave under pressure and mess up then get taken out of games. Even if it's IM's I would defintely still do that if I was in high school. I was just not used to pressure.,"This year I'm hoping to just be an overall more competitive person. I need to work harder, get better grades, win more games, play less video games, and just be more strict with myself. Self control is definitely a thing. Regardless, 2015 was quite the experience and I enjoy just rambling. Who knows, this could be the start of something new. Kenny has told me for years that blogging is a good activity. But I only really got interested after reading Karen's :). I literally cop everything."
